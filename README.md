# Advent Of Code
This is a repo for my solutions to the Advent of Code problems.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about) is a digital advent calendar released each year filled with a number of problem briefs that are best addressed through coded solutions. The problem specifications are provided with individual inputs and require a certain output in line with the problem brief, but are otherwise left open as to the implementation details.

## Languages
The language that I use to address the challenges can vary by year, the following is a list of the languages that I have used in each year's solutions:

- 2022: Python
- 2023: Rust
- 2024: Python
- 2025: Python
